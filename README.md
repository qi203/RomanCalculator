# Roman-Calculator
##### This exercise includes the Code for Roman Numeral Calculation which only involves addition and subtraction. Only the basic code for addition and subtraction is written. The library is tested using the C's Unit Testing Framework "CHECK".

First submission assumed that there is no operation such as (+) & (-) and so the addition and subtraction functions were implemented without using the operators as shown in  [Roman Arithmetic]. In this implementation I have assumed that there (+) & (-) operators are available and so only a little code is written for achieving the functionality.

[Roman Arithmetic]: <http://turner.faculty.swau.edu/mathematics/materialslibrary/roman/>
The program now compiles with the following command.

$ make

There are a total of 29 Test Cases that involve testing the arguments validity, addition and subtraction results.

Cheers!
